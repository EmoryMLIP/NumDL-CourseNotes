# Course Material: Numerical Methods for Deep Learning

This repository contains lecture slides and MATLAB codes for a one-semester graduate-level class on numerical methods for deep learning.

This course was first designed and taught by [Lars Ruthotto](http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~lruthot/)[Emory University](http://www.emory.edu) and [Eldad Haber](https://sites.google.com/site/ehaberubc/home)[University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/) in the Spring of 2018. 

## Scope 

This course provides students with the mathematical background needed to analyze and further develop numerical methods that at the heart of deep learning.  The course is simultaneously geared towards science students, who may be interested/experienced with deep learning and would like to strengthen their theoretical foundation, and mathematics students, who may have a background in numerical analysis and who are curious about the emerging technology of deep learning.  The course primarily targets graduate students. However, exceptional advanced undergraduate students may be admitted on a case-by-case basis.

The ultimate goal is to implement a simple, mathematically sound deep learning code from scratch. This look under the hood will provide valuable insight into successful and well-tested software packages for deep learning tasks and understand their success (and failure). Students will use MATLAB to code basic concepts.
